Always wash and pat dry the bhindi before you chop it. Chop the top and tail ends of each bhindi/okra. Cut okra into 1â€³ pieces and spread out on a plate for a few minutes, approx 3-4 mins so that it is free of any moisture.
Cook the okra on high flame for the first 3 minutes and then reduce flame to low medium. Do not place lid while cooking bhindi.
Add lemon juice or a tbsp of buttermilk during the first few minutes to cut down on the slime.
Do not mix the bhindi often as it tends to become mushy.
Add salt towards the end of the cooking process.
